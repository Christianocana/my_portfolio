                        <p>
                            Me and my team members worked on a semester-long capstone project about machine deep learning
                            and experimented on how well they can interpret images from MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100
                            datasets with noise label corruption. Our experiments and data training span architectures
                            such as CNNs, DenseNet, ResNet, and Vision Transformers at varying levels of symmetric label
                            noise. In the end, our findings provided practical insights for determining the necessary
                            methods for noisy-label learning that can be applied to the real world.

                        <h3>Guess Quest</h3>
                        <h5>Type: Group Project</h5>
                        <h5>Timeline: Oct-Dec 2024</h5>
                        <p>
                            Me and two other students created a game called Guess Quest as our custom project for one of
                            my classes. In Guess Quest, players take turns to find items in nodes at certain locations.
                            Players can find good items and bad items in each of the nodes, and players can gain points
                            for finding the good items. Players can take turns to guess, move to different locations
                            according to the map, use hints to identify what remains in the game, and to quit out of
                            the game. The game and its attributes are created by a hosting client and acts as the host
                            server for the game so that other clients can connect to it by using a three-way handshake,
                            allowing the game to run on a TCP connection of the players, and lets players take action
                            when it is their turn and prevents them from taking action when it is not their turn. This
                            video demonstrates more of what to expect once the program starts running.

                            class so that they can connect with each other. The website is also designed to form
                            study sessions for peers with the same school and class to participate in. The following
                            listed below is what we used in developing our project.

                            Over the summer of 2024, I worked as an intern for FreightPop. During my time as an intern
                            I provided quality assurance for improving the company’s software website and application,
                            identified and fixed bugs and vulnerabilities using the debugging feature, prevented SQL
                            injection, masked data stored in the database, and caught unexpected errors to negate bugs
                            and provide better security and experience for users. Below is what the company used for
                            their software application, though I spent most of my time there working on areas of the
                            backend and database.
